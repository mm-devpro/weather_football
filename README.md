### RELATIVITY WITHIN WEATHER AND FOOTBALL GAMES  

**We decided to check if weather is correlated with football results.**  

3 rates (between 0 and 1) have been made from weather side, on the venue :  
- weather conditions => humidity, cloud coverage
- weather beauty => sunny/raining...
- temperature avg over the day

From football side are taken into consideration:  
- whether the team is playing home or away
- whether the team won, lost or drew
- the number of goals and the goal difference

With all the results, we will analyze if the weather can correlate with game results
